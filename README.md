# Python-Experiments DM
This repository is my initial learning experience with GitHub in DSCI 8133, _Foundations in Data Science_.

## Plan
Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook that will interact with the file.

## About Me
My name is Darren McGee. I am a veterinarian by training, and I specialize in dairy cattle performance medicine. Importantly, **the use of data** has become a key aspect of my professional life. My areas of work in the dairy industry include:
- Practicing veterinarian
- Dairy farm owner and manager
- Technical services veterinarian for Elanco Animal Health
